# USRC Simulated Robotics Tutorial

## What's in this tutorial?
1. Using Docker and Gazebo to set up a virtual robotics environment
2. Controlling a robot using ROS
3. Creating a robot using URDF/SDF files
4. Combining OpenCV and Gazebo

## Prerequisites
1. Knowing how to open a terminal on your base operating system
2. Knowing what `cd` is in a terminal and how to use it.

## Why this tutorial?
Other tutorials e.g. ROS, Gazebo tutorials assume that you know what linux is and have a linux system ready. 

This tutorial is built so that you can run everything in the tutorials on your Windows / Mac device, and follow along. 

Also, it's more "Wow, cool!" with a little bit of "This is how you do actual work" than the other tutorials which assume you have some experience in real robotics.

## Challenges for Tutorial Series
If you're doing the USRC Tutorial Series, check out the "USRC Weekly Workshops" section in the README for each workshop to find the corresponding challenge. 

## Future things
- Create a tutorial that integrates STL files and urdf files.
- Create a tutorial for xacro files instead of urdf files.
